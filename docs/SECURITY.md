## 🔐 Azure Terminal Security Policy

### 📜 Reporting a Vulnerability
Azure Terminal is committed to maintaining a secure project and responding to security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. If you find a security issue in Azure Terminal, please follow the steps below to report it.

#### 1️⃣ **Do Not Open Public Issues**
For the security of the project and its users, **do not** open a public GitHub issue to report security vulnerabilities. Instead, please follow these steps:

#### 2️⃣ **Contact the Maintainers Directly**
- Send a private report to the project maintainers by opening a security issue via GitHub's private reporting system or contacting us via email at:  
  `cosmicnovanebula@gmail.com`.
- Please include the following details:
    - A clear description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
    - Any relevant code, configurations, or scripts to help us understand the issue.

#### 3️⃣ **Security Review**
Once we receive your report, the project maintainers will:
- Acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours.
- Review the issue and work on a fix as quickly as possible.
- Coordinate a public disclosure (if necessary) after the issue has been addressed and patched.

### 🚨 Responsible Disclosure
We ask that security vulnerabilities be disclosed privately and responsibly, allowing us to address the issue before making any information public. Once a fix is deployed, the vulnerability details will be disclosed to the public, crediting the reporter (if desired).

### 🔒 Security Updates
The Azure Terminal project will:
- Provide security updates and patches for any reported vulnerabilities.
- Announce any security-related changes in the changelog, along with the version number and details of the fix.

### 🛡️ General Security Guidelines
While Azure Terminal strives to maintain a secure project, we also encourage contributors and users to adhere to these security best practices:
- Keep sensitive information, like API keys or credentials, out of the repository (use `.gitignore` or environment variables).
- Regularly update dependencies to ensure that security vulnerabilities in libraries or packages are minimized.
- Follow secure coding practices and review code for potential vulnerabilities before submitting pull requests.
